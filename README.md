-This project looked into the aspects of Kickstarters, particularly plays within theater. Upon looking at the data my recomendation is that we go forward with the play kickstarter as plays are a very successful within the already very successful theater parent category. There needs to be a lowering of the goal, based on the descriptive statistics. We want to be anywere between $3,000 and $5,000 as our goal. Finally, begining our kickstarter in May or June would be highly advantagous as these months seem to be yeilding the highest success rates.
